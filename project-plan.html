      <h2>Project Overview</h2>


      <h3>Topic</h3>

      <p>For the group project of our choice, we have decided to go with the idea of an Adaptive Chess Engine. This engine is a neural network that automatically adapts to the user’s skill level after the user has played a couple of chess games against the engines. After those couple of games, the engine can gauge the user’s skill, only then changing their difficulty of playing against the user. This is designed for people who may want to perform better at chess, or want to learn how to play the game, as the adaptive chess engine is a way to coach these newcomers into playing the game better, making the right moves. And that can only happen overtime with the many games the user has played with the engine, as the engine learns about the moves the user has made, what openings they have played against them, what mistakes and blunders they may have committed in playing against the engine, all of this information is what will contribute into how the engine will play against the user the next time they do so, as they have a play history with them.
      </p>

      <p>We expect the outcome to be fully functional at most with a moderate number of bugs as expected in the initial stages of development, therefore requiring plenty of feedback from users who use it to further improve its quality. As the engine is further developed however, we expect it to be debugged and checked before it becomes a complex engine that can go through series of algorithms with ease, having minimal errors in its code. We hope to share our creation and make it open source, for other like-minded users to hop in, hoping to further improve its quality and efficacy or modify it to their liking. However, in the grand scheme of this project we would like to make a prototype of this engine with inclusion of its deep machine learning and complex AI in hopes that with future technological advancements, it can be improved significantly than what it is currently, hoping to entice and show to any potential future employers./p>

      <h3>Motivation</h3>

      <p>We were motivated by a desire for each of us with our varying levels of skills in chess to be challenged. Although some of us are much more experienced in chess than others, we all enjoy the game and would love to be challenged by an adaptable chess engine when playing the game. This not only helps us learn, but also makes us a better player each time we interact with the chess engine. We intend for the finished project to be easy to use and a great introduction to the modern trend of machine learning and AI being used in a practical and enjoyable way. Chess is such a world-renowned game and played by millions of people all around the world, therefore the practical application of our project could allow us to benefit those who partake in this hobby. The prominent rise of machine learning and AI in today’s age means that we are staying on trend with the current IT landscape. For those of us who would like to undertake and pursue a career in AI or other forms of software development and programming, this project would be a great showcase to any potential future employers.
      </p>

      <h3>Landscape</h3>

      <p>The closest high-end competitors that exist at a professional level are those developers of the MAIA and Leela Chess engines, from a small independent group and a detachment from one of Google’s AI learning departments, respectively. These chess engines are primarily renowned for their heavy resource-intensive systems that focus largely on machine-learning as opposed to brute-forced database searching, to emulate a certain human playstyle as accurately as possible. Both have professional-grade programmers and engineers to develop and design how each UI and system would function, based on an extensively researched form of deep learning. Comparatively to our one, we want to implement as little buttons as possible as to have the engine automatically adapt to the user’s relative skill level, as opposed to dedicating more time and resources for each skill bracket.</p>

      <h2>Detailed Project Description</h2>

      <h3>Aims</h3>

      <p>The main specific aim of this project to reach the end goal of creating a Chess Engine that functions the way it is meant to be, adapting to the user’s skill level in chess without any additional inputs and modifications. Should this be achieved, there are multiple goals that need to be completed in order to contribute to the full functionality of the Chess Engine as well as achieving the end goal of providing a full extensive neural network and AI. </p>

      <p>First off, there is to be a presentable GUI presented to the user that shows the full chess board with all the correct number of pieces. To have setup the engine, I searched up the internet to see how a chess GUI would be able to create within a coding language. I have recently found out that Python has its own integrated chess module which provides necessary legal moves, proper move notation, as well as a rudimentary interface that consisted of ASCII characters. It requires importing a python chess module via the pip program, alongside the IDE of choice that can run Python. This would be the top priority for development as there would need to be a way for not only users to play chess with engine, but where the engine can process what move to make through the neural network’s data on the user’s past games. </p>

      <p>The next goal to be achieved is creating the neural network. In terms of the neural network, the plan is for it to be integrated entirely into python alongside the initial chess project to minimise clutter. Python is capable of sporting even the most rudimentary minmax analysis of that in machine learning with several videos and articles, and I am aiming to create a code that can emulate that as closely as possible. Ideally, this would be the second priority for development. Especially because there is a lot of study and mechanics that go behind it aside from just simply creating the network. Additionally, after the engine is made to the level where it can play chess with, and only then the neural network can be developed and integrated with the chess engine, allowing it to adapt to the user’s skill level at chess. </p>

      <p>After gathering the neural network and a working chess engine that a user can play against, all that is left to do is to test if the engine and the neural network works as it was intended to be. As stated, the engine adapts to the user’s playing style after playing several games with the user. To test this, it is simple as playing as many games with the engine as possible. Only then, we can see if the engine is adapting to the user level of play with the neural network that is in place, achieving its main purpose as a result. Ideally, this is the last task that should be done once both the engine and the neural network are integrated and ready for testing. While it may be possible to test the product during certain stages of development to see if it is functioning, it would be better to test the product in its supposed “finished” state. After all the goals of development are achieved, only then the project would have reached its aim of a fully functional adaptive chess engine for chess players, new or old, that they can play with. </p>

      <h3>Plans and Progress</h3>

      <p>The project development started from a discussion between ideas with the team to see which project was the most feasible in the respective timespan. After some time, the group ended up with going with Franco’s idea that is the Adaptive chess engine, which was the most feasible out of the other four ideas as it wasn’t necessarily reinventing the wheel and the fact that there are other chess engines out there that function, but not to the level that Franco wishes to produce. </p>

      <p>After selecting the idea, as per the assignment two requirement, Franco worked on creating the description of the project idea. A chess engine that has a neural network within its code, adapting to the user’s level of play after a set number of games with the engine as it learns through the moves that the user makes in each game it plays with the engine. Every opening, check, blunder, or mistake can determine what skill level the user is at in chess with the engine as the opponent. It was doable in the sense that Franco chose code it on python, that, and the knowledge he has surrounding existing chess engines that function, but not adaptive to the skill level Franco had imagined. </p>

      <p>Once the description was created and placed in the assignment two report, there was planning out how to create the adaptive chess engine. The steps were simple from a glance, but hard when it is put into the process of working on it and creating it. First, creating an acting and working chess engine that a user that can play against. Next, set up a neural network so that the chess engine can adapt to the users play style, playing to their skill level as a result. Lastly, once gathering all the required components set up for the project, there was only testing that was left to do to see if the engine can adapt to the skill level as intended. </p>

      <p>Once the plans were in place of how the project would be created with aims and goals in mind, it was time to put into work. With the GUI creation being borrowed from Python’s integrated chess module, as well as not requiring any external graphics or icons as of writing. However, there are plans to allocate free-to-distribute icons and images to create a quick serviceable code that can play chess. Being built together and integrated into the module, this should be a plan to easily implement alongside the necessary resources and labour to properly refine the script.</p>

      <p>After creating the GUI for the Engine, so far, the project consists of a very rudimentary methodical chess engine that only moves in an uncomplicated way, without any advanced machine learning algorithm as it falls beyond my skill level at the time of writing. It has been a journey working closely with Python's chess module. Were we able to learn about creating the machine learning algorithm, it would have taken more time to develop the engine to its full completion and for to be able to adapt to the user's skill level. </p>

      <p>The code progress has been somewhat simple as python already has an integrated chess module that provides a starting point to create something that collaborates with said module. However, designing an extensive machine-learning code with fully functional minimaxing and branch pruning in a limited time at a beginner skill level is difficult. As for this issue, I ensured that there was something to present that at least provided a basic form of gameplay. Issues that have arisen has been that the project still requires some polishing, as some minor errors and scenarios cause the program to brick at times. Otherwise, it is fully functional as a prototype to display, of course, without the neural network in place as that would take an extensive amount of time to not only learn how to create it, but to set up for the project to function to its full effect. </p>

      <p>In the end, only the working prototype of the working chess engine was made as a result. By the time that GUI was made, there was not enough time to even set up a neural network or even test the project due to the due date arising. Were we able to pass it on to another development team or were given more time to be able to work on the project a little bit more, the other steps of setting up the neural network and testing the product would have been feasible and the project would have led to its completion for the public for newcomers or professionals of chess to it out for themselves. </p>

      <p>For example, freelancers who have a minimum of a bachelor's degree, and/or extensive scripts and renowned programming skills that are widely recognised within a large community as part of a portfolio. With people who have these skills and qualifications, they can be allocated to create a simple minmax neural network learning code that can be implemented into the python script. However, prior study on necessary topics within the fields of machine learning and programming are required to properly implement and compose code that can be applied to a necessary fully functioning chess code.</p>



      <h3>Roles</h3>

      <p>---------------------------------------------------</p>

      <p></p>

      <h3>Scopes and Limits</h3>

      <p>By the time we meet our set group deadline, we will hopefully have relative parts of the chess engine and its GUI functionally complete as we do not have much time available and cannot possibly complete the full project. As it stands currently, we will only be able to present the engines GUI and what it aims to do in terms of functionality through series of tests and minimal levels of required code to show what it is capable of. With further testing and development, the project will aim to be fully functioning with minimal bugs and errors, thoroughly tested to give users the best experience when using the engine. If it was to be complete, the engine will be able to amass data and read players moves, changing its algorithms to match the players skill level, being able to always improve its AI further as it constantly used through complex machine learning.</p>

      <p>Upon discussing with developers in the Chess community, we have been informed that the scope of such a project would take much longer than predicted. This is due to the fact that we would need to build a functional AI algorithm, be able to successfully implement a proper extensive API from one of the major chess websites and incorporate all this data into a massive database. These steps alone could take months to complete and would require a much more experienced and dedicated team to develop each concept.</p>

      <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>

      <p>There is no purchasing or copyrighted material required to access this. All that is required is a functioning laptop (preferably with a higher-end GPU for more extensive analysis). There is much to be researched with properly integrating a chess website API consisting of millions of player games, at each skill rating bracket, as well as massive blocks of code of proper algorithm learning with machine learning.</p>

      <p>Tools used for this project are Python which is where the code for the Chess Engine is stored, and the Neural Network processes the user’s skill level. Everyone in the group has had prior experience with Python, however, Franco will be the one solely developing the project, not only be using python to code the engine, but as well as learning about other python features as there may be some other features he may need to learn about for the development for the engine and the neural network when developing it. Additionally, I used VSCode for the entirety of the project; a text editor that is tailored to languages like python, as well as for other languages. This is where all the coding is in as a centralised hub.</p>

      <h3>Testing</h3>

      <p>As python has its own chess module, we will use this to its fullest potential to create a prototype application that is entirely run in Python, to provide some tangible information and to showcase what python can do, in terms of chess usability. Currently the module only utilises ASCII imagery as a substitute for the graphics as a prototype, with a planned integrated GUI with PNG sprite pieces. These prototypes can be created to provide forms of visual elements that can be integrated into the code itself.</p>

      <p>If user testing being to be put in place, there would need to be a set number of users to be tested. The users background would preferably be those who are well experienced in chess, near grandmaster level, as well as some who are well skilled at chess, and complete beginners to see if the engine would adapt to their skill level after some games against with the engine itself. The varying skill levels of those users chosen to test the engine can show that the engine does adapt to the user’s skill level. </p>

      <h3>Timeframe</h3>

      <p>--------------------------------</p>

      <h3>Risks</h3>

      <p>There are risks that may arise, especially when developing a chess engine and a neural network. For instance, when building a chess engine, there is a lot to learn regarding the code and the processes that come with it. It can be difficult to learn, especially within the limited time given to create and present the engine to the level that it is functional and working. Another risk that comes in is incorporating it into an application. While creating the code for the engine and the neural network is hard enough, there is the challenge of making the code work on an application in either a desktop or a mobile setting. Examples such as Chess.com and lichness.org have chess computers users can play against, with open-source chess engines used to not only go against human players, but also give users the option to play against the computer within a set difficulty.</p>

      <h3>Group Processes and Communication</h3>

      <p>For this project, we each agreed to partake in at least one meeting a week from the outset. Due to circumstances outside of our control and due to lack of communication, some of the team members did not meet this expectation. We recorded a weekly meeting with automated transcripts through the use of Microsoft Teams. If a team member could not attend the weekly meeting, they were encouraged to look through the recording, transcript, and meeting agenda to see if they missed any vital information for the project. Each team member was assigned roles and duties at the beginning of the project, and we tried to stick to a timeline by utilizing the website Trello. Some team members chose to not adhere to the provided timeline and did not complete their tasks by the allocated due dates which significantly impacted the rest of the team. The lack of communication and adherence to the strict schedule set out from the beginning meant that we were severely behind on the project idea and could not complete it to the best of our abilities, compounded together with the lack of communication within the team. This goes to show that communication would have to be the most vital part of a group project and any instance where a team member chooses to not attend a meeting or supply updates on their progress severely affects the workflow and morale of the team.
