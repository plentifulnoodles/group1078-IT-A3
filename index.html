            <p>Hello! My name is Regi Cruz, my student number is s394256. I am a first-year student studying at RMIT, enrolled in the Bachelor of Information Technology. I was born and raised from the Philippines on the 28/08/2003, but spent most of my childhood back in Dublin, Ireland. It was only until 2010 that my parents decided that we started a new here in Australia and I have lived here ever since for the past 12 years. In my spare time, I enjoy gaming on my laptop, I do love singing in my spare time (and when no one is watching) and I normally just enjoy reading sometimes. My interest in IT sparked whenever I decided to play video games as a young child. As I grew, I began to have an interest and understanding in how devices and technology generally worked. By the time I started year 10 at my high school, I chose Computing as a subject, where I was introduced and experienced coding with python, databases with Microsoft Access and Spreadsheets. I enjoyed it and continued to go along with that subject in Year 11 and 12, where I also learned about project planning with Gantt charts various other topics.

            <p>Hi, my name is Kye Cisternas, and I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia. My father is originally from Chile in South America and moved here when he was 10 years old to start a new life with his parents and siblings.  My mother was also born in Australia with mostly Scottish ancestry. As an avid world traveller, I have been able to see some incredible things. From riding a camel and attending a traditional Bedouin campsite in Dubai, to witnessing the active volcano Kilauea erupting in Hawaii. My most memorable moment, however, would have to be visiting the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, USA. I am always in awe at the scale and vastness of outer space so getting to see and touch a rock from the moon and the space shuttles was such an unforgettable experience. I have also recently found a new albeit expensive hobby in collecting limited sneakers. I am currently studying the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT however this is not my first degree at this institution. After graduating high school, I pursued an Advanced Diploma of Building Design (Architectural) as I had a keen interest in Architecture and the built environment. I successfully completed this two and a half year course, however I began to realise that the work and industry was not what I was expecting. I decided to abandon that pathway and shift my focus to the world of Information Technology. My interest in IT began at an early age. I remember always being excited when my dad allowed me to use his computer to play games or browse the internet via dial-up, or even watching my favourite childhood shows on a VCR video tape. Simply being able to watch the transitions from VCR to DVD to now being able to instantaneously stream makes me wonder what else the world of IT has in store for us.

            <p>Hello, My name is Franco Celis, identified as s3947046. I am currently in my first-year studying for a bachelors in Information Technology as part of my course. I hail from the Philippines, having myself and my biological parents born there. I have been introduced to the expansive world of IT when moving to Australia, having opened many wild ideas and scenarios about working in that respective field. However, I am still very new to the landscape of making creations within this world, as opposed to consuming it- so the concept is something I am excited about delving deeper into. I currently enjoy chess as a favourite pastime of over a decade, having obtained several medals and won championships over the years, both in Australia and overseas, and a distant hope to represent Australia at least on the national level, if not international. I currently work on art as a freelance hobby, being one of the other pastimes that I actively try to advertise and improve, as it acts as a sporadic burst of motivation.

            <p>Hi, my name is Janssen Cabanada, I am 18 years old and was born on the 17/02/2004. I was born in the Philippines and moved here in Australia in 2005 when I was 5 years old. I am currently studying my first year in RMIT enrolled in the Bachelor of Information Technology and my student number is s3946837. I have spent most of my childhood in Australia and can speak a little bit of my native language. Whenever I have time to spare, I enjoy gaming on my computer and my favourite game is “League of Legends”, which I have been playing since 2011. It was through gaming that my interest in IT began as I wanted to know how games were being made and programmed and the mechanics and logistics of a mouse and keyboard. I chose computing as a subject in year 11 and 12 and learnt to use Gantt chart, learning how to create projects. During year 11 I also did a little bit on Java and created a website using html without using the use of CSS and delve into a little bit of databases towards the end of year 12, using MS Access.

      <h2>Group Processes</h2>
      <p>Our group did work well together in completing assignment 2. We assigned tasks in the report to do for each other with Kye creating the entire website to have the rest of the other members collate the content and information researched into the website. However, as we were in a rush due to minimal time, we were unable to get an interview in place for the last assignment, which resulted in use having to go for the alternative of researching professional IT figures, which is the more time-consuming process, but nevertheless got it done despite the minimal time we have left. Additionally, according to our feedback from assignment 2, there was not much explained regarding the skills that should be obtained for our career paths and was little commitments to the scope for the project, which may have also been a result due to the lack of time that was left until submitting the assignment.  As a result of this, we have decided to implement Trello to aid in our tracking completion of tasks. If we can get the tasks done sooner, we could potentially have the assignment done earlier rather than later, thereby avoiding any problems we may have such as the one we have faced in the last assessment.  Moving forward, we will change the group delegations and dynamic to try and share the work equally for each step of this assignment, with each member contributing something to each part. We will utilize the program Trello to maximise our efficiency, allocate the spread of work equally and ensure we are meeting deadlines on time, thus improving our time management and teamwork skills.
      </p>

      <h2>Career Plans</h2>
      <p>So far, everyone in the group has not decided to change their job and have stuck with their original chosen ideal job. Regi and Kye share similarities in their respective paths, both intending to start a career in the security sector. Franco and Janssen also share a desire to find work as software developers. Some differentiating factors between the two chosen career paths of our team members are the prerequisites for entry into the fields and required skills. For example, the software developer pathway is much more programming oriented and heavily reliant on knowledge in certain computer languages whilst the security pathway combines hands on and analytical skills when testing or defending against cyber-attacks.
      </p>

      <p>Regi: For my career path as a Security Analyst, I hope that while learning the skills, soft or required skills need for the career path of my choice, I hope to have the chance to gain an internship or some work experience regarding cybersecurity earlier than later, that way I can have a better understanding in what to do in becoming an security analyst, what mindset, skills and other requirements I may need before settling down on this path for good. Regardless, I will also learn more skills should the time come that I ever become a security analyst myself, as working on that job also gives experience as well.
      </p>

      <p>Kye: To prepare myself for a career in my chosen path as an offensive security consultant I would ideally seek out an internship or placement within the security sector upon completion of this course or even whilst completing my final year. I plan to graduate from this course with my bachelor's degree which would be considered more appropriate and desirable for this position than my current diploma. This course will greatly enhance my knowledge in information security and give me some technical experience in relevant areas dependent on my electives. I believe I already satisfy most of the required skills which I have gathered from my prior work experience and education, in particular my ability to work well independently and in a team, and my persistence to learn and problem solve in various environments.
      </p>

      <p>Franco: For my career, I plan on working primarily within the digital department, focusing on aspects with careers and plans of that of a software developer or programmer (with secondary options should this fail to be feasible under any circumstances). I chose this specific course as it allows a much broader general picture of the industry to allow me to collate and select certain aspects of the industry, so that I can properly specialise in a certain field(s). I am hoping to gather as much necessary career-oriented information to allow me to select a proper specialisation, and to be able to guarantee a job after the obtaining the degree. A lot of this will revolve around self-learning sessions and sporadic bouts of research in the topic of IT, to maximise information collection with languages, ideas, and prospects of this part of STEM.
      </p>

      <p>Janssen: As my career path revolves around being a Software Developer, as I progress throughout my course, I am hoping to have a chance to gain an internship with a gaming/tech company whether it is regarding the completion of my course or just for experience. I hope to gain these skills and required qualifications so that I can have competency later in the future when I do land a job in the field of IT. In the meantime, I will find other ways to improve and hone my skills so that when the time comes to use and apply those skills in a practical/working environment, I can become an even better developer than I was just learning and reading the material beforehand.
