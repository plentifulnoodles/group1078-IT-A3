            <p>Hello! My name is Regi Cruz, my student number is s394256. I am a first-year student studying at RMIT, enrolled in the Bachelor of Information Technology. I was born and raised from the Philippines on the 28/08/2003, but spent most of my childhood back in Dublin, Ireland. It was only until 2010 that my parents decided that we started a new here in Australia and I have lived here ever since for the past 12 years. In my spare time, I enjoy gaming on my laptop, I do love singing in my spare time (and when no one is watching) and I normally just enjoy reading sometimes. My interest in IT sparked whenever I decided to play video games as a young child. As I grew, I began to have an interest and understanding in how devices and technology generally worked. By the time I started year 10 at my high school, I chose Computing as a subject, where I was introduced and experienced coding with python, databases with Microsoft Access and Spreadsheets. I enjoyed it and continued to go along with that subject in Year 11 and 12, where I also learned about project planning with Gantt charts various other topics.

            <p>Hi, my name is Kye Cisternas, and I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia. My father is originally from Chile in South America and moved here when he was 10 years old to start a new life with his parents and siblings.  My mother was also born in Australia with mostly Scottish ancestry. As an avid world traveller, I have been able to see some incredible things. From riding a camel and attending a traditional Bedouin campsite in Dubai, to witnessing the active volcano Kilauea erupting in Hawaii. My most memorable moment, however, would have to be visiting the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, USA. I am always in awe at the scale and vastness of outer space so getting to see and touch a rock from the moon and the space shuttles was such an unforgettable experience. I have also recently found a new albeit expensive hobby in collecting limited sneakers. I am currently studying the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT however this is not my first degree at this institution. After graduating high school, I pursued an Advanced Diploma of Building Design (Architectural) as I had a keen interest in Architecture and the built environment. I successfully completed this two and a half year course, however I began to realise that the work and industry was not what I was expecting. I decided to abandon that pathway and shift my focus to the world of Information Technology. My interest in IT began at an early age. I remember always being excited when my dad allowed me to use his computer to play games or browse the internet via dial-up, or even watching my favourite childhood shows on a VCR video tape. Simply being able to watch the transitions from VCR to DVD to now being able to instantaneously stream makes me wonder what else the world of IT has in store for us.

            <p>Hello, My name is Franco Celis, identified as s3947046. I am currently in my first-year studying for a bachelors in Information Technology as part of my course. I hail from the Philippines, having myself and my biological parents born there. I have been introduced to the expansive world of IT when moving to Australia, having opened many wild ideas and scenarios about working in that respective field. However, I am still very new to the landscape of making creations within this world, as opposed to consuming it- so the concept is something I am excited about delving deeper into. I currently enjoy chess as a favourite pastime of over a decade, having obtained several medals and won championships over the years, both in Australia and overseas, and a distant hope to represent Australia at least on the national level, if not international. I currently work on art as a freelance hobby, being one of the other pastimes that I actively try to advertise and improve, as it acts as a sporadic burst of motivation.

            <p>Hi, my name is Janssen Cabanada, I am 18 years old and was born on the 17/02/2004. I was born in the Philippines and moved here in Australia in 2005 when I was 5 years old. I am currently studying my first year in RMIT enrolled in the Bachelor of Information Technology and my student number is s3946837. I have spent most of my childhood in Australia and can speak a little bit of my native language. Whenever I have time to spare, I enjoy gaming on my computer and my favourite game is “League of Legends”, which I have been playing since 2011. It was through gaming that my interest in IT began as I wanted to know how games were being made and programmed and the mechanics and logistics of a mouse and keyboard. I chose computing as a subject in year 11 and 12 and learnt to use Gantt chart, learning how to create projects. During year 11 I also did a little bit on Java and created a website using html without using the use of CSS and delve into a little bit of databases towards the end of year 12, using MS Access.

      <p>I never played much sport growing up, however, I've always been a fan of both American Grid Iron, Australian Rules football and soccer. I was fortunate enough to tick an item off my bucket list and attend the Superbowl 51 in Atlanta, United States. As an avid world traveller, I have been able to see some incredible things. From riding a camel and attending a traditional Bedouin campsite in Dubai, to witnessing the active volcano Kilauea erupting in Hawaii. My most memorable moment however would have to be visiting the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, USA.

      <h2>Interest in Information Technology</h2>
      <p>Information Technology has always amazed me with it's endless possibilities. There are so many different pathways one can choose to venture down and I believe they all significantly improve our lives. Whether that be in the medical industry, entertainment, security, or design, Information Technology has proved to us all that we simply cannot live without it. </p>

      <p>My interest in IT began at an early age. I remember always being excited when my dad allowed me to use his computer to play games or browse the internet via dial-up, or even watching my favourite childhood shows on a VCR video tape. Simply being able to watch the transitions from VCR to DVD to now being able to instantaneously stream makes me wonder what else the world of IT has in store for us. Something as simple as looking at Wikipedia pages was so fascinating for me. With the dawn of websites such as YouTube, I was able to watch endless videos of tech unboxings and learn about the different specifications and hardware that would go into everyday products such as laptops, mobile phones and digital cameras. Marques Brownlee, also known as MKBHD, was and still is a great source of inspiration for my interest in IT thanks to his simple yet informative YouTube channel which focuses on reviewing the latest tech and gadgets releasing around the world.</p>

      <p>Having already studied at RMIT University made it an easy choice for me to choose this institution once again. Living in the western suburbs of Melbourne does not leave me with too many choices for universities that are easy to access by public transport, however RMIT meets my needs. The location is prime in the Melbourne Central Business District and within reach of many students, making it an easy commute for everyone I have spoken to. I am very familiar with the facilities and location of amenities that this university provides. RMIT is also one of Australia's top performing universities and "Ranked in the top 100 globally for Computer Science and Information Systems programs" from Best Global World University Rankings (2021).
      </p>

      <p>In this degree, I expect to learn the basic concepts of Information Technology as well as a variety of IT and general elective courses. In particular I would love to learn some more advanced programming and security in Information Technology. I expect to graduate and be able to use the knowledge gained throughout this course to start and pursue a promising career in the IT industry.</p>

      <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
      <a href="jobad.pdf"target="_blank">Offensive Security Consultant (Penetration Testing)</a>

      <p>This job with Loop Offensive Security Services (OSS) is for experienced penetration testers who can bring their technical expertise, consulting, and leadership skills to their team. Pen testing or penetration testing involves the digital and/or physical attack on a computer system to check for vulnerabilities or exploits. This job would involve working independently and in a team to perform various methods of penetration testing. Physical Intrusion testing is one particular aspect of this job that appeals to me. The ability to try and test for vulnerabilities in a company's security system on-site would make for a thrilling and challenging task. Other tasks associated with this role would include; testing of web apps, mobile apps, internal and external infrastructure, simulated phishing campaigns, and adversary simulation or red teaming.</p>

      <p> The ideal candidate does not require a postgraduate qualification in Information Technology, however it is expected that candidates have practical training in at least one penetration testing discipline as well as at least one security certificate. Examples may include GPEN, GWAPT, GMOB, GXPN, GCPN, OSCP, OSWE, OSEP, OSEE, CREST, CISSP. Security professionals looking to apply must have relevant experience of 1-5 years experience working independently on penetration testing, 1-5 years working experience with internal/external penetration testing methodology,  1-5 years working experience with web application or mobile application penetration testing methodology, experience effectively delivering small to medium engagements. Knowledge and effective use of Windows Active Directory attack techniques, cloud platform attack techniques, Linux attack techniques, and web/mobile application attack techniques are also all mandatory prerequisites for this job. Candidates should be persistent and open to learning, work well independently as well as in a team, detail and achievement oriented, have excellent written and verbal communication and strong interpersonal skills.
      </p>

      <p>I'm an RMIT graduate who is currently working for Covid-19 Quarantine Victoria (CQV) as a Resident Support Officer. My current position with the Victorian State Government as a Resident Support Officer has given me the skills to work in a highly stressful environment. I follow and adhere to strict infection prevention and control protocols and am able to adapt quickly and change when presented with a challenge. I provide a great sense of care, compassion and customer service for the residents that I supervise in the Victorian Hotel Quarantine program. I am a team player with excellent problem solving and communication skills. Prior to my current position, I worked as a data entry operator for an administration company, where I handled confidential information in a range of projects with a high level of tact and discretion. Accuracy and attention to detail when inputting data is one of my highest priorities. I graduated from RMIT University in 2018 with an Advanced Diploma of Building Design.
      </p>

      <p>I plan to graduate from RMIT University again with a Bachelor of Information Technology, which would be considered more appropriate and desirable for this position than my current diploma. This course will greatly enhance my knowledge in information security and give me some technical experience in relevant areas. After completion of this course, I intend to find a graduate job with an information security company. Once I have satisfied the required years of experience, I would need to obtain an IT security certificate such as CISSP or GPEN. With the 1-5 years of experience working in a security based role and my relevant security certification, I would then be able to apply for the position of Offensive Security Consultant. I believe I already satisfy most of the required skills which I have gathered from my prior work experience and education, in particular my ability to work well independently and in a team, and my persistence to learn and problem solve in various environments.

      <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
      <div id=profileimages>
        <img src="consul_indepth.jpg" alt="Consul personality traits" style="width:100%">
      </div>

      <h3>Myers Briggs Personality Test</h3>
      <p>Based on my Myers-Briggs personality test, I am a Consul ESFJ-T. This means I can be categorised in one of two options for 5 different categories, those being Extroverted, Observant, Feeling, Judging and Turbulent. It is a very common personality type with 12% of the global population categorizing themselves as Consuls.</p>

      <h4>Strengths</h4>
      <p>Consuls can be described as the pillars of the groups in which they belong to and tend to always be relied upon as they are very loyal. They make for extremely trustworthy employees and partners and value stability and security very highly. Being sociable, comfortable and well-liked is necessary for a Consul. They are very open to talk to and naturally play an active role in their communities. Due to having a strong sense of duty, consuls are determined to meet their goals and obligations, although this may stem from their desire to keep their social reputation. Consuls have strong practical skills, ensuring that those around them are taken care of and are outstanding at managing their routines and everyday tasks. Caring deeply and maintaining peace with others, Consuls are always there to put others happiness first. They take pride in being selfless but also ensuring that the team gets the job done.</p>

      <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
      <p>Consuls can become very defensive when questioned on their choices, especially if it is someone close to them. They find it challenging to be put on the spot as they avoid conflict and are vulnerable to criticism. Stemming from one of their greatest strengths, Consuls may also find that worrying too much about their social status can be a hinderance. This can affect the decisions they make and limit their potential for creativity. It can be daunting for them to step outside their comfort zones due to fears of rejection or appearing as different. Consuls love to feel appreciated, so if their efforts towards others are not being noticed they tend to feel disheartened. Another strength turned weakness is that Consuls are too selfless and empathetic. They can often forget about themselves in their quest to please all those around them.</p>

      <p>I believe that the results of my Myers-Briggs test are a fairly accurate representation of my personality. It is interesting to see that I could fall into either category for many of my results, with my 'Extraverted' mind trait being especially close at 52%. Personally, I do believe I am more 'Introverted' rather than 'Extroverted' as I tend to keep to myself more often than not. My most dominant trait is my nature of 'Feeling' at 64%, which in my opinion is still quite close to being the inverse trait of 'Thinking'. As a 'Sentinel' I do tend to be self-motivated and follow a more technical rather than creative approach in projects. </p>

      <p>As a Consul, I believe I thrive when working in teams. I am very determined to meet the goals of a business and care deeply about my team members and their needs. As discussed in the strengths section, Consuls make for extremely trustworthy employees and are very social. This loyal trait I believe is extremely invaluable and something I take great pride in. My goal when working in a team is always to get the job done efficiently and effectively as possible.
      </p>

      <p>I can be relied on when forming a team as communication is one of my strongest skills and being able to stay on top of the task at hand and manage routines efficiently and effectively is vital for me. I am happy to talk openly with everyone and do have very strong practical skills. I'm not afraid to take the lead in a group setting, however I am quite vulnerable to criticism which can let me down at times.</p>

      <h3>LifeTrain Learning Style Quiz</h3>
      <div id=profileimages>
        <div class= centredimage>
          <img src="learningstyles.png" alt="Learning style quiz results" style="width:50%">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The results of the test above are taken from LifeTrain's learning style quiz. This quiz is used to determine how we approach things and the different ways in which we all learn. The pie chart gets segmented into 4 parts that depict the learning styles of Reflector, Theorist, Pragmatist and Activist. The percentages are determined by the simple yes or no answer to 24 quiz statements. As you can see, my Theorist and Pragmatist learning styles dominate most of the chart with the two results accounting for a combined 62%. As a pragmatist learner, I tend to be more technical and therefore abstract thinking is one of my weak attributes. I tend to think rationally and choose to learn more based on common theories and principals. I feel as though pragmatist and theorist learning styles go hand in hand in this regard and accurately represent my preferred way of learning.</p>

      <p>Given my fairly equal split of learning styles, I believe my behaviour when working in a team would be advantageous. I may tend to take a back seat at times to observe what is going on, but once I do begin to understand I am able to work in an effective manner. With my reflector learning style, I can use the information gathered from previous experiences and observe other methods of learning to help me function in groups. My downfall may be my inability to be as open-minded as others when trying to learn something new as I prefer to focus on a more practical and theoretical approach to my work.</p>

      <p>I encourage discussions with those I work with, thus making it very easy to form a team or be an active member in one. I prefer to put ideas into practice as soon as possible rather than dwell on abstract thinking or reasoning which makes for an efficient workflow. I very much believe in tutorials as a way to engage a group and encourage input from every team member to get the most out of our efforts. Having a strict and disciplined theorist learning style has allowed me to focus on rationality and keeping on top of the task at hand, which is vital for a team that needs to meet their goals.</p>


      <h3>IPIP Big Five Factor Markers</h3>
      <div id=profileimages>
        <div class= centredimage>
          <img src="big5test.png" alt="Big 5 Factor Markers results" style="width:65%">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>These are the results of my IPIP Big Five Factor Markers test. In this test I was given a raw score alongside a score percentile to determine the strength or weakness of my personality traits in five big factors. They are a commonly used model of ones personality and used frequently in psychology studies. The traits include Extroversion, Emotional Stability, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Intellect/Imagination. Once again this test highlights the difference between extroverts and introverts and categorizes me more appropriately as slightly more introverted when compared to my previous Myers-Briggs personality test. As can be seen in my results I scored in the 41st percentile for Extroversion, placing me as a slightly more introverted person however I do still enjoy socializing and do not enjoy being isolated in my personal life. Having a high score in the third factor, Agreeableness is typical of me as a friendly and optimistic person.</p>

      <p>I am a welcome addition to a team environment due to having such a high score in the fourth factor, Conscientiousness. This is reflected in the fact that I am diligent and take pride in my work and do not make irrational decisions that may negatively impact the team. I do not have a neurotic personality, therefore I would not be shy or irritable when communication is key.</p>

      <p>When forming a team I am very approachable and friendly to be around. I may not be the loudest person in the group due to being slightly more introverted, however my presence is still known and I am always open to listening. I may struggle a bit with my creativity and imagination, however I make up for this with my ability to be more technical and conventional in my approaches to work in general and in group settings.</p>
