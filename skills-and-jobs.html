      </p>

      <h4>Complex Understanding of statistics, probability, and linear algebra</h4>

      <p>As AI models are built using algorithms, they are heavily reliant on statistic, algebra, and calculus. Furthermore, you must be familiarized with probability to interact with the common AI machine learning models, including the “Hidden Markov”, “Gaussian mixture” and “Naïve Bayes” models.
      </p>


      <h4>Programming Skills</h4>

      <p>As with any specialised field of IT, you will need to have a solid and rudimentary understanding of well-known and studied programming languages like C++, Java, R and Python. AI development is not any different. To develop and deploy AI models, you will need to utilize these programming languages.
      </p>

      <h4>Soft Skills</h4>

      <ul>
        <h4>• Communication Skills</h4>

        <p>Artificial Intelligence developers are often required to communicate their plans, progress, data and any technical information to a wide range of individuals; whether it be other developers or maybe any possible clients who are interested in the field and technology to be used for the personal or organizational gains. For this reason, you will need to be an excellent verbal communicator.
        </p>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <h4>•	Collaboration Skills</h4>

        <p>In tandem with communicational skills, developers in this field often and need to work within a team of other IT developers or with another team member, so you must possess the capability to work efficiently and effectively within a team.</p>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <h4>•	Critical Thinking Skills</h4>

        <p>To be highly successful within the field of AI, you will need to be able to come up with innovative and exciting AI models or solutions. To achieve this, you must be capable to do some rapid prototyping. As ideas are not necessarily perfected on the first attempt, you will need to be capable of several tests and modifications of models to suit the needs of whoever is interested in your project. Success will fully depend on how useful the model is to a certain client or a company.</p>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <h4>•	Creativity</h4>

        <p>As the AI field in the IT industry is relatively new, modern, and exciting innovations are being thought of and brought to fruition every day to solve a really complicated problem or to make current technologies easier to use and understand.

      </ul>

      <h3>Chess Programmer</h3>
      <h4>Position Description</h4>

      <p>Chess programming, under the broader category of programming, is a specialised role within the IT field to compose and fabricate machines and algorithms that are provided via databases and extensive user data, to compile statistics and best-move-predictions within a given chess position. These programmers are tasked with gathering all necessary code and databases to create the best possible outcome of a position via an extensive min-max algorithm with proper alpha-beta pruning and database searching abilities, as well as managing their coded engine to function as optimally as possible. After all these steps are checked and readied, the chess programmer handles outputting the best possible move (in the given scenario and limits) to emulate either the statistically best move, or the most human-like one in this case.</p>

      <h4>Essential Skills</h4>

      <p>As the IT and digital field are new in terms of career opportunities, the sudden resurgence and exponential growth and development of the modern world has provided countless opportunities and jobs for emerging creators and entrepreneurs. Because of how new the concept of coding as a career is, it has slightly different skill requirements as compared to the older more traditional jobs, and these include:</p>

      <p>A minimum of a bachelor’s degree in the relevant field(s) of:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Information Technology</li>
        <li>Computer science</li>
        <li>Software Engineering</li>
        <li>Any relevant degrees that work closely with the digital industry</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Extensive understanding with several coding languages, as well as existing ones within one of the many major chess websites (Lichess with Scala, stockfish with C++ and Javascript).
      </p>

      <h4>Programming Skills</h4>

      <p>As a chess programmer, these are necessary aspects of the jobs as they work together in tandem to both manage a chess engine within the site(s), as well as having an existing degree with necessary qualifications in order to work at an optimum level without distributing much needed company resources with internships and apprenticeships for a certain employee(s).</p>

      <p>These coding languages are crucial to the function of chess engines as they serve as the foundation for all algorithms to function at. For example, stockfish is developed with the help of C++, and thus having prior (extensive) knowledge and/or background with this language would prove useful to help contribute towards the source code, as well as creating new concepts and implementations within the given labels.</p>

      <p>Because chess programmers specialise in the fields of creating chess engines and their necessary information, a good grasp of collating necessary data, as well as thinking critically under pressure in important time-limited situations, as well as adapting to the environment.</p>


      <h4>Soft Skills</h4>

      <ul>
        <h4>•	Proper Communication</h4>

        <p>Proper coding integration is an important aspect of creating an efficient chess energy. However, this is impossible to achieve if a team has no cohesion with a given project, the whole project can stagnate or even crumble. To offset this, a chess programmer must be very tightly interwoven with his team and communicate with them as properly and frequently as possible, to ensure updates are to be relayed to the whole group and its members. </p>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <h4>•	Efficient problem solving</h4>

        <p>The IT field is a complete maze of problem solving on the spot, adapting with the flow of work and situation, whilst remaining calm and rational throughout. Interpreting this and thinking in an abstract manner allows chess programmers to innovate through complex problems and to imagine wild scenarios to hypothetical situations while having the ability to follow through with even wilder solutions.</p>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <h4>•	Creativity</h4>

        <p>Just like traditional media, programming and coding are forms of art; acting as intricate instructions. Being able to think freely allows a chess programmer to compose wild and even unfeasible solutions that surprisingly work. Having a team that can think freely like this will be extremely beneficial.</p>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <h4>•	The ability to scrutinise</h4>

        <p>Programming is a fragile art, where one incorrect syntactical error can completely brick the full workings of a written code. Chess programmers must be able to write their code properly and have keen eyes to search through the code and to pick out any glaring errors that might cause issues with running the engine and/or GUI.</p>
      </ul>

      <h3>Data Analysts</h3>
      <h4>Position Description</h4>

      <p>Data Analysts job is to simply analyse the data that is provided to them, whether it be data involving numbers, games, statistics of any kind, their job is to solve a certain problem or even find some occurring problems within the data that they receive, gaining insight along the way. In this context, the data analyst would need to determine if the chess engine is appropriately doing its job of adapting to the user’s skill level, and even checking if it’s receiving the necessary data to switch up its way of processing its moves. And after gathering all the data, processing it, checking for some positives and negatives, they are to present it to the people in charge, which in this case is the people who made the engine.</p>

      <h4>Essential Skills</h4>

      <p>There are both Soft and career specific skills needed for this job, especially when it involves programming in some form and in a language that the analyst is familiar with. But before that, there are some education qualifications required:</p>

      <p>The person would need to receive a bachelor’s degree in either:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Information Technology</li>
        <li>Data Analytics</li>
        <li>Computer Science</li>
        <li>Any degree involving analysis of data</li>
      </ul>
