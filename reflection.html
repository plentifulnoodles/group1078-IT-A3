      <h2>Reflection</h2>

      <p>Group: Throughout the project, our use of Microsoft Teams can be seen as a positive. It allowed us to collaborate easily and all work on the one file simultaneously with many different editing tools at our disposal. We were able to tag each other in posts and coordinate a weekly meeting with little to no issues, which was an excellent way to hold one another accountable. Without the use of such a system, the team would not have been able to collaborate as well and perhaps would not have met any deadlines at all. One of the biggest drawbacks in this assignment was communication issues towards the end of the assignment and the project. In the beginning, the team had cohesive and thought-out plans on what we were going to do and who was going to do who. Delegations of tasks were set, and everyone did them as expected. However, when a group member caught an illness and was behind 2-3 days of information on the group report, communication between members suddenly were put on a halt and barely anyone spoke to each other, teams or private messaging. Communication is necessary in group projects, especially when someone is behind due to unforeseen circumstances and could have improved within our group. A new discovery that gave our group a mild surprise was that python had its own module just dedicated for chess. This allowed the team to have a starting foundation to work on. Another surprising discovery during the working on the project is how insurmountable the project seemed given the timeframe of the project, as well as the lack of resources freely accessible. It was an ambitious project idea, only hampered by the limited understanding of full extensive coding of a machine, given how even professional freelancers and hired employees spend at least several months minimum creating a serviceable engine, let alone a high-functioning competitive one. One of the most important things we have learned about groups is that huge commitments are needed to be taken when taking on a project this huge. This was evident as by the end of the assignment, there was still so much work to have been done and the project had much more potential than in its current state. But because due to personal circumstances some group members faced, we were unable to live up to that standard of the project reaching up to that level of potential. This was a lesson worth learning, and worth taking note of.

      <p>Kye: In this assignment we started out working well and managed to come up with a cohesive plan and timeline to complete the project. This early phase however was the only positive from this assignment, as upon reflection our IT project was not completed to the standard that we would have liked. Unfortunately, due to a team member not being as vocal and communicating their progress throughout the assignment, we began to fall behind and were not able to produce a proper prototype. Communication is key in assignments like this, and it could be improved to allow us more time to collaborate as a team and achieve the tasks set out for each other in a meaningful way. It was surprising and disappointing to see less effort put into this assignment than there was in our earlier assignments given the weight of marks this assessment carries. I would like to see team members take initiative next time and ensure they are submitting work according to our clearly marked schedule. I have learnt that working in groups can be an effective way to undertake larger projects, but only if all team members are sharing the workload equally and standing up for the team.

      <p>Regi: In my perspective, the group was a bit better at keeping up with the tasks compared to the last assignment, however there was still some negatives and challenges that we faced. For what went well was the communication and proper delegation of tasks for the assignment. Kye and I made sure that every task delegated to each other and for Janssen and Franco were to be completed and up to date by not myself but for others, to ensure that we are making the most out of the time we have until the due date for the assignment. What could have been improved was the completion of the project idea, since we only had the code set up for the chess engine that only simply plays chess on python, we didn’t really have much to present in a desktop format as per the plan that was set up for the project. One thing that was surprising is that despite some hiccups while working on the assignment, we still managed to get it done. And the one thing that I learned about groups is that delegation of tasks is important, as makes it clear what everyone must do for the project.

      <p>Franco: In this assignment, it was remarkably interesting to see the inner workings of how neural networks are so heavily integrated into chess as a board game, with so much research and lines of code to contribute to even composing one of the simplest engines. Unfortunately, due to the project idea and its familiarity with the team, it was difficult to communicate properly with the team due to lack of exposure and knowledge within the chess industry. The most that surprised me personally, was both that Python itself had an integrated module specifically dedicated to chess, as well as the copious amounts of code required for an extensive neural network piece of AI capable of translating relative skill levels, utilising existing chess APIs. Because of this, it was difficult to properly code a fully working chess AI engine within the period required with little workforce to share across a group, as well as having it delegated solely on one person, which would strain the development of the engine itself. This has hampered the progress of the entire chess engine code which I have been unable to find necessary resources for in the time slot. One thing that I learned about groupworks, and team-members, is that project ideas are best implemented if everyone has a grasp on the concept idea and can easily contribute together and integrate ideas easily, as opposed to one idea that only one person can work on and have everyone “in the dark” with the project. Communication together is a very crucial concept that easily connects all ideas and team-members, as well as understanding on the topic.

      <p>Janssen: I felt like in this assignment, we had better group communication than last time in the beginning of the assignment as I saw more comments being left by the team members compared to our last assignment. However, we still had a communication problem with one other team member, who wasn’t really communicating back to the rest of the team and only came to the meetings to report on their attendance. Aside from this, all the group members relatively did well on their delegated tasks throughout the group report and most of us were communicating with each other through private messaging or through the teams group. A thing that was surprising that we found in this meeting was the lack of a group members contribution towards this project. I found this a bit odd as in prior assignments, he was communicating with us as much as the others did and we even chose his project as a basis for our group project. However, this did not last long as throughout this final assignment, as more meetings and group were completed, he did not respond to anything, halting our progress on the report and the project significantly. One thing that I have learnt during these types of group assignments is that if even one person is behind, it throws a wrench in the works so communication and delegated tasks must be complete before deadlines set by the group are up, or else major consequences will occur, and important timings will be missed.
